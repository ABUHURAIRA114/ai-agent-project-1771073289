## Introduction
Graph Generator in C++ is a console-based application that generates and displays graphs. The project uses C++ to create a simple and efficient graph generation tool.

## Features
* Generates graphs in the console
* Supports different graph types (e.g., adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
* Allows user to customize graph size and structure
* Displays graph in a readable format

## Requirements
* C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
* Console or terminal

## Usage
1. Compile the project using `g++ graph_generator.cpp -o graph_generator`
2. Run the executable using `./graph_generator`
3. Follow the prompts to customize and generate the graph

## Installation
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-generator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd graph-generator`
3. Compile and run the project using the instructions above

## Example Use Cases
* Generating a graph for a network topology
* Visualizing relationships between entities
* Creating a graph for a data structure or algorithm
